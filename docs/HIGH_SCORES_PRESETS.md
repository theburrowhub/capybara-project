## Automatic Population

**The high scores are populated automatically!**

When you run the game for the first time (or if the database doesn't exist), the system automatically:
1. Creates the database at the appropriate location
2. Creates all necessary tables
3. **Populates the high_scores table with the 40 legendary developers**

No manual action needed - just run the game and the high scores will be there! üéÆ

## Manual Reset Tool (Optional)

If you want to reset the high scores back to the original presets, you can use the optional tool:

```bash
# Force repopulate (clear existing scores and restore presets)
make force_populate_highscores
```

### Commands

1. **Normal mode** - Checks if scores exist, only populates if empty
   ```bash
   ./bin/populate_highscores
   ```

2. **Force mode** - Clears existing scores and repopulates with presets
   ```bash
   ./bin/populate_highscores --force
   ```

### Building Only

```bash
make populate_highscores
```

## Technical Details

- **Total Entries**: 40 (10 per difficulty)
- **Database**: SQLite3 at `~/Library/Application Support/CapybaraProject/game.db` (macOS)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Maintains only top 10 per difficulty
- **Timestamps**: Each entry gets a unique timestamp

## Integration

The presets integrate seamlessly with the game's high score system:
- **Automatic population** on first run - no setup required
- Scores appear immediately in the "High Scores" menu
- **Navigate between difficulties** using LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys in the High Scores menu
- Each difficulty displays its own top 10 legendary developers
- Color-coded difficulty selector: üü¢ EASY, üîµ NORMAL, üü† HARD, üî¥ INSANE
- Players can compete against these legendary developers from day one
- New player scores automatically slot into the correct position
- If a player beats a preset, that developer's score is pushed down or removed
- The system only populates once - existing scores are never overwritten automatically

## Motivation

These presets serve multiple purposes:
1. **Inspiration**: Players compete against gaming legends
2. **Challenge**: Meaningful goals for each difficulty level
3. **Education**: Introduction to gaming history and influential developers
4. **Immersion**: Creates a living leaderboard from day one
