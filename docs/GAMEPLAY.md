  - ðŸŸ  Orange: 50-75% (Warning)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: 75-100% (Critical)
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple: Overheated

### Enemies
- 10 unique enemy types with different behaviors
- Each type has unique stats (health, speed, damage, resistance)
- Spawn from the right side of screen
- **Points**: Varies by enemy type (8-50 damage on collision)
- **Full Details**: See [Enemies and Sprites Documentation](ENEMIES_AND_SPRITES.md)

### Obstacles
Two types of obstacles spawn randomly:

#### Destructible (Orange)
- Can be destroyed with 2 hits
- Changes color when damaged
- Worth 50 points when destroyed

#### Indestructible (Gray)
- Cannot be destroyed
- Must be avoided
- Instant death on collision

### Difficulty Progression
The game increases in difficulty over time:
- Speed increases every 20 seconds
- Affects:
  - Enemy movement speed
  - Obstacle movement speed
  - Background scroll speed
  - Spawn rates
- Visual warning 5 seconds before speed increase

## Scoring System

- **Enemy Kills**: Points vary by enemy type
  - Swarm: 80 points
  - Grunt/Speeder: 100-150 points
  - Tank/Elite/Boss: 300-500 points
- **Obstacle Destroyed**: 50 points

- **Combo Multiplier**: Chain kills for bonus points

## Game Over Conditions

The game ends when:
- Player health reaches 0 (from enemy collisions)
- Player collides with any obstacle (instant death)

## Tips & Strategies

1. **Positioning**: Stay mobile but avoid the right side
2. **Priority Targets**: Clear destructible obstacles for points
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn enemy movement patterns
4. **Risk vs Reward**: Destroying obstacles gives points but risks collision
5. **Collect Powerups**: They drift away quickly, prioritize shield and weapon upgrades
