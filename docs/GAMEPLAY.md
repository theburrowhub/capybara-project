#### Destructible (Orange)
- Can be destroyed with 2 hits
- Changes color when damaged
- Worth 50 points when destroyed

#### Indestructible (Gray)

- Instant death on collision

### Difficulty Progression

## Scoring System

## Game Over Conditions

The game ends when:

- Player collides with any obstacle (instant death)

## Tips & Strategies

1. **Heat Management**: Fire in bursts to avoid overheating
2. **Positioning**: Stay mobile but avoid the right side
3. **Priority Targets**: Clear destructible obstacles for points
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn enemy movement patterns
5. **Risk vs Reward**: Destroying obstacles gives points but risks collision
